# Italy – Five Reforms That Could Work

This repository hosts a compact, data-driven working paper on what **could** realistically move the needle on Italy’s long-run growth and institutional quality.

Instead of generic calls to “do reforms”, the project focuses on **five concrete levers**, each described with:

- at least one measurable KPI (productivity, R&D intensity, governance);
- a baseline for Italy today;
- a plausible target scenario;
- an order-of-magnitude estimate of the potential impact.

All scenarios are **illustrative**: they describe what *could work* under specific assumptions, not a guaranteed policy outcome.

## The five reforms (high-level)

1. **Rebalance public pension spending**  
   Gradual but meaningful reduction in pension expenditure as a share of GDP, mainly by:
   - tightening access to early retirement and special regimes;
   - slowing indexation for higher pensions;
   - aligning retirement ages to life expectancy.  
   Part of the savings is used to stabilise public debt; part is redeployed to growth-enhancing items.

2. **Invest in universities, research and advanced human capital**  
   A sustained increase in:
   - public spending on universities and tertiary education;
   - R&D intensity and technology transfer;  
   with the explicit goal of moving Italy closer to the upper half of EU innovation performers.

3. **Scale up firms and reduce micro-firm fragmentation**  
   Policies to encourage:
   - mergers, aggregations and business networks;
   - professional management and governance in mid-caps;  
   with the aim of shifting value added from micro firms to more productive small and medium-sized enterprises.

4. **Speed up justice and contract enforcement**  
   A persistent effort to:
   - shorten the time to resolve civil and commercial cases;
   - increase the predictability of enforcement;  
   to reduce one of the main non-tax barriers to investment and firm growth.

5. **Simplify taxes and public administration for productive investment**  
   Streamlining of:
   - tax incentives for investment and innovation;
   - administrative procedures for hiring, exporting and investing;  
   with an emphasis on stability and credibility over time.

Each reform is treated as a separate “line” in the paper, but the interesting scenarios come from **combining** them.

## Repository content

- `README.md` – overview and motivation.
- `paper.md` – full working paper with:
  - baseline diagnostic on productivity, pensions, education, R&D and governance;
  - five reform blocks with indicative magnitudes;
  - a combined long-run scenario and a short political-economy discussion.

There are **no additional data files**. All quantitative statements are based on publicly available sources cited in the paper (OECD, Eurostat, World Bank, Banca d’Italia, etc.).

## How to use this project

- As a **conversation starter** on Italy’s policy priorities, especially for students and practitioners.
- As a template for similar projects on other countries: one markdown README, one markdown paper, a few well-chosen indicators.

## Disclaimer

This is a personal, exploratory exercise.  
The five reforms discussed are not a political programme. They are stylised scenarios that **could work** under specific assumptions and strong implementation capacity.
