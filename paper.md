# Italy – Five Reforms That Could Work  
### A Stylised, Data-Driven Scenario for Growth and Institutions

---

## Abstract

Italy combines significant real-economy strengths with persistent structural weaknesses. It is the second-largest manufacturer in the euro area, yet it suffers from low labour-productivity growth, modest innovation, heavy public pension expenditure and slow justice. This paper sketches five mutually reinforcing reforms that **could** improve long-run growth and institutional quality:

1. a gradual **rebalance of public pension spending**;
2. a sustained **increase in investment in universities and research**;
3. policies to **scale up firms and reduce micro-firm fragmentation**;
4. a long-term effort to **speed up justice and contract enforcement**;
5. **tax and administrative simplification** focused on productive investment.

For each reform, the paper provides:

- a baseline, based on recent public data;
- a target scenario that remains within the bounds of European experience;
- a rough estimate of the potential impact on productivity, public finances and institutional quality.

The analysis is intentionally simple and relies on order-of-magnitude calculations. The scenarios are not forecasts and not a political programme. They are a disciplined thought experiment on what **could work** if Italy chose to concentrate on a small number of evidence-based priorities.

## 1. Introduction

Italy’s long-run challenge is well known: for more than two decades, productivity growth has been weak, real wages have stagnated, public debt has remained high and demographic ageing has accelerated. At the same time, Italy retains:

- a strong manufacturing base, especially in machinery, food and specialised industrial products;
- high household wealth;
- valuable human capital in selected industrial districts and research niches.

Rather than attempting to cover the full reform agenda, this paper focuses on a narrow question:

> If Italy decided to do **five** focused, evidence-based reforms, what combination could plausibly deliver the largest long-run payoff?

The answer is organised around five levers that interact with each other:

1. pensions and the age structure of spending;  
2. universities and research;  
3. firm size and productivity;  
4. justice and contract enforcement;  
5. taxation and administrative complexity.

## 2. Baseline: where Italy stands

This section summarises a few indicators that frame the problem. Numbers are indicative and refer to the most recent pre-2026 data available from international sources.

### 2.1 Productivity and firm structure

- **Labour productivity (GDP per hour worked, PPP)** – Italy is close to the OECD average but below France and Germany, with a long period of stagnation and only modest recent gains.  
- **Firm size** – the productive system is dominated by micro and small firms. SMEs employ a very large share of the workforce and generate most value added, but productivity of micro firms (0–9 employees) is significantly below EU comparators.

### 2.2 Pensions and demographics

- **Public pension expenditure** – Italy is among the OECD countries with the highest public pension spending as a share of GDP, significantly above the OECD average.  
- **Demographics** – the old-age dependency ratio is projected to rise substantially over the next decades, putting further pressure on the system.

### 2.3 Education, universities and R&D

- **Overall education spending** – total public expenditure on education as a share of GDP is slightly below the EU average.  
- **Tertiary education and R&D** – spending on universities and research is modest compared with innovation leaders; R&D intensity is around the lower third among advanced economies.

### 2.4 Governance, justice and trust

- **Time to enforce contracts** – civil and commercial cases typically require several years to reach a conclusion, longer than in most EU peers.  
- **Perceived corruption and trust in government** – surveys place Italy below the top tier of OECD countries in terms of perceived integrity and trust in institutions.

These features reinforce each other: heavy age-related spending crowds out growth-enhancing items; micro-firm fragmentation and slow justice depress investment; low trust in institutions reduces support for painful reforms.

## 3. Reform 1 – Rebalancing public pension spending

### 3.1 Motivation

Italy’s pension system delivers relatively generous benefits at relatively low retirement ages for many cohorts, but at the cost of very high aggregate spending and a significant transfer from younger to older generations. In a context of high public debt and low growth, this crowding-out effect is particularly damaging.

### 3.2 A “could work” scenario

The paper considers a **gradual, rules-based** adjustment over 15–20 years, centred on three elements:

1. **Stricter access to early retirement and special regimes**, phasing out the most generous pathways except for genuinely hard and hazardous work.
2. **Indexation reform**, with:
   - full inflation protection for low and medium pensions;
   - partial indexation for higher pensions, especially above a multiple of average earnings.
3. **Automatic links to life expectancy**, with retirement ages and contribution periods adjusting mechanically over time.

The objective is to **reduce pension expenditure by a few percentage points of GDP** relative to the no-reform baseline over two decades, not through sudden cuts but via predictable rule changes.

### 3.3 Use of savings

In this scenario, pension savings are split between:

- **fiscal stabilisation** – lowering the debt trajectory and interest-burden risk;  
- **reallocation to growth-enhancing items**, primarily universities, research and justice (see subsequent reforms).

This rebalancing does not eliminate intergenerational tensions but could make the system more sustainable and free resources for future-oriented spending.

## 4. Reform 2 – Investing in universities, research and advanced skills

### 4.1 Motivation

Italy’s under-investment in tertiary education and R&D contributes to weak innovation performance, low TFP growth and a persistent “brain drain”. The gap with leading EU countries is large enough that even partial convergence could have meaningful effects.

### 4.2 A “could work” scenario

The paper sketches a 15-year plan with two pillars:

1. **Universities and advanced education**
   - gradual increase in public spending on universities and student support;
   - targeted expansion of competitive research funding and doctoral programmes;
   - stronger governance and performance-based criteria for additional funds.

2. **R&D and technology transfer**
   - incremental tax incentives and grants for private R&D, with an emphasis on evaluation and stability over time;
   - support for university-industry collaboration, especially in manufacturing districts and green / digital transitions.

The quantitative target is to **raise R&D intensity and tertiary-education investment** to levels closer to the EU average, using part of the pension savings as a dedicated funding source.

### 4.3 Expected impact

Empirical literature suggests that higher R&D and human-capital investment can raise long-run productivity growth. In the Italian case, even a modest increase in trend TFP growth would significantly improve the debt dynamics and income per capita over a 20- to 30-year horizon.

## 5. Reform 3 – Scaling up firms and reducing micro-firm fragmentation

### 5.1 Motivation

Italy’s industrial strength coexists with an excess of very small, under-capitalised firms. These micro firms often:

- have limited access to professional management and modern technologies;
- struggle to export beyond niche markets;
- remain below the size thresholds where productivity and wages increase.

### 5.2 A “could work” scenario

The paper considers a set of measures aimed at **making it easier and more attractive to grow**:

- simplified procedures and tax rules for mergers, aggregations and business networks;
- stable incentives for equity capitalisation and professional governance in SMEs;
- growth-friendly thresholds in labour and tax law that avoid cliff-effects when a firm hires the nth worker or crosses a turnover limit.

The quantitative thought experiment assumes that, over time, a non-trivial share of micro firms either exit or scale into small-and-medium-sized enterprises with productivity closer to EU benchmarks. The implied increase in aggregate value added could amount to several points of GDP in the long run.

## 6. Reform 4 – Speeding up justice and contract enforcement

### 6.1 Motivation

Slow and unpredictable justice is consistently cited as a major obstacle to investment, especially for foreign investors and for domestic firms considering long-horizon projects. Lengthy civil and commercial cases function as an implicit tax on doing business.

### 6.2 A “could work” scenario

The reform package includes:

- continued **digitalisation of procedures** and case management;
- more extensive use of **specialised courts** and standardised templates for common disputes;
- performance-based incentives for courts to reduce backlogs;
- careful monitoring to ensure that efficiency gains do not compromise due-process guarantees.

The target is to **reduce time to enforce contracts** significantly over a decade, moving closer to the better-performing EU countries. The benefits would likely include:

- lower required returns on investment to compensate for legal risk;
- more efficient credit markets (collateral and insolvency procedures);
- higher trust in institutions.

## 7. Reform 5 – Tax and administrative simplification for productive investment

### 7.1 Motivation

Italy’s tax system and administrative procedures are complex and unstable. This is particularly harmful for investment decisions, which depend heavily on predictable rules. Frequent changes – even when well-intentioned – create uncertainty and planning costs.

### 7.2 A “could work” scenario

The paper explores a **simplification and stabilisation agenda** with three components:

1. **Consolidation of tax incentives** for investment and innovation into a smaller number of well-designed, evaluated instruments.
2. **Stable medium-term commitments** on key tax parameters relevant for business investment (e.g. corporate tax rate, treatment of retained earnings and equity, R&D incentives).
3. **Administrative one-stop shops** and clear timelines for:
   - opening a business;
   - obtaining basic permits;
   - hiring, exporting and investing.

The goal is not necessarily to reduce the overall tax burden dramatically, but to **improve its composition and predictability**, especially for firms that invest, innovate and export.

## 8. Putting the five reforms together

The five reforms are most powerful when **combined**:

- Pension rebalancing frees fiscal space and reduces long-term risk.
- Part of that space finances universities, research and justice, raising productivity and institutional quality.
- A better operating environment and more skilled workforce make it easier for firms to scale.
- Simpler taxes and administration reduce the fixed costs of formality and growth.

A stylised macro scenario where:

- pension expenditure is gradually reduced relative to GDP,  
- R&D and tertiary-education investment converge towards EU averages,  
- justice and administrative barriers are significantly eased,

would likely deliver higher potential growth and a more sustainable debt path than a continuation of the status quo. The precise magnitudes depend on modelling assumptions, which this paper deliberately keeps simple.

## 9. Political economy and risks

Any serious reform plan must confront Italy’s political-economy constraints:

- losers are concentrated (e.g. groups affected by pension tightening or by the closure of unproductive tax loopholes);  
- winners are diffuse and materialise over long horizons (younger cohorts, future workers and taxpayers).

The pension and justice reforms, in particular, require:

- clear communication about **intergenerational fairness**;
- credible guarantees that savings will finance visible improvements in education, research and administration, not only short-term deficit targets.

There is also implementation risk: partial, inconsistent or reversible reforms could generate political costs without delivering benefits.

## 10. Limitations and possible extensions

This working paper has several limitations:

- it uses **high-level, aggregated indicators** rather than detailed micro data;
- it does not model general-equilibrium interactions between reforms;
- it abstracts from European-level constraints and opportunities (fiscal rules, EU funds, single market reforms).

Possible extensions include:

- building a small numerical model to simulate debt and growth paths under different reform combinations;
- applying the same “five-reform” template to other countries;
- incorporating political-economy scenarios explicitly (e.g. gradualism vs big-bang, coalition dynamics).

## Conclusion

Italy’s problems are serious but not mysterious. A combination of demographic pressure, weak productivity growth, under-investment in universities and research, micro-firm fragmentation, slow justice and institutional complexity has produced a low-growth, high-debt equilibrium.

This paper does not claim to have the solution. It simply argues that a **small set of focused, evidence-based reforms** – rebalancing pensions, investing in universities and research, scaling up firms, speeding up justice, simplifying taxes and administration – **could work** in moving Italy towards a more sustainable and dynamic path, provided they are implemented with persistence, credibility and a clear sense of intergenerational fairness.
